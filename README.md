# Creating a Tool for Dynamic Carrier Ranking by Route and Load Type  

This project was developed as the **Capstone Project** of the 12-week **Data Analytics Bootcamp at Spiced Academy**.  
The goal was to create a tool for **Cinch** to provide better insights into their customers’ logistics expenses.  

## 🔎 Project Overview  

The tool dynamically ranks carriers based on:  
- **Route** (origin-destination pairs)  
- **Load type** (FCL, LCL)  
- **Cost and performance metrics**  

This allows Cinch to:  
- Compare carriers more effectively  
- Identify cost-saving opportunities  
- Support data-driven decision-making in logistics management  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack 
- **Metabase** (extracting data) 
- **Python** (data cleaning, analysis, ranking logic)  
- **SQL** for querying and data extraction  
- **Tableau** for visualization  


## 📊 Key Features  
- Data preprocessing and transformation of logistics datasets  
- Dynamic ranking algorithm for carriers  
- Interactive visualizations of carrier performance  

## 🚀 Outcome  
The final tool provides Cinch with a **data-driven approach** to understand carrier performance across different routes and load types, enabling **smarter logistics decisions** and **cost transparency**.
